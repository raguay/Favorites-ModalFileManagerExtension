## Favorites for Modal File Manager

This is an extension to assign favorite folder locations to go to quickly in the [Modal File Manager](https://github.com/raguay/ModalFileManager). The current features are:

- Create/Delete Favorite directory locations with assigned names
- Create/Delete Aliases to often used directories that are shared between computer systems with assigned names.
- Go to a favorite directory based on assigned name.
- A favorite directory keyboard mode called `fav` and is switched into the 'fav' mode by 'normal' mode 'f'.
- `q`, `w`, `e`, `r`, `t` go to the 1st through 5th saved directory in the 'fav' mode and then switches to the 'normal' mode.
- `Q`, `W`, `E`, `R`, `T` sets the 1st through 5th saved directory in the 'fav' mode and then switches to the 'normal' mode.
- A directory history with the ability to jump to the past visited directory. No key assignments are made for it. But, you can go to them from the command prompt. The commands are `Backup to x Directory` where x is 1 through 5.
